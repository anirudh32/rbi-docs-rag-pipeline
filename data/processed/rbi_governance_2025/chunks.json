    "text": "63. Guidelines: a PVB shall implement necessary policies or systems  to ensure \nadherence to the guidelines delineated below which are based on the FSB \nPrinciples for Sound Compensation Practices  and their Implementation \nStandards, as well as current statutory and regulatory framework in India.  \n(1) Guideline 1: Compensation Policy \nA PVB shall formulate and adopt a comprehensive compensation policy covering \nall its employees and conduct annual review thereof. The policy shall cover all \naspects of the compensation structure such as fixed pay, perquisites, \nperformance bonus, guaranteed bonus (joining / sign-on bonus), severance \npackage, share-linked instruments e.g. Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOPs), \npension plan, gratuity, etc., taking into account these Guidelines. \n(2) Guideline 2: NRC \nThe NRC of the B oard of a PVB shall oversee the framing, review and \nimplementation of compensation policy of the PVB on behalf of the B oard. The \nNRC shall work in close coordination with RMCB, to achieve effective alignment \nbetween compensation and risks. The NRC shall also ensure that the cost/income \nratio of the PVB supports the compensation package consistent with maintenance \nof sound capital adequacy ratio. \n(3) Guideline 3: For WTDs / MD&CEO / CEO / MRTs \nA PVB shall ensure that for the WTDs / MD&CEO / CEO / MRTs: \n(i) compensation is adjusted for all types of risks,\n\n(ii) compensation outcomes are symmetric with risk outcomes, \n(iii) compensation payouts are sensitive to the time horizon of the risks, and \n(iv) the mix of cash, equity and other forms of compensation are consistent \nwith risk alignment. \nA wide variety of measures of credit, market, liquidity and various other risks shall \nbe used by a PVB in implementation of risk adjustment. The risk adjustment \nmethods may preferably have both quantitative and judgmental elements. The \ncompensation shall also be in compliance with all statutory requirements. \nThe compensation structure for the WTDs  / MD&CEO / CEO / MRTs of a PVB \nshall be as under: \n(i) Fixed Pay and Perquisites : A PVB shall ensure that the fixed portion of \ncompensation is reasonable, taking into account all relevant factors \nincluding adherence to statutory requirements and industry practice. All \nthe fixed items of compensation, including the perquisites, shall be treated \nas part of fixed pay. It may be noted that all perquisites that are \nreimbursable shall also be included in the fixed pay so long as there are \nmonetary ceilings on these reimbursements. Contributions towards \nsuperannuation / retiral benefits shall be treated as part of fixed pay. \n(ii) Variable Pay \n(a) Composition of Variable Pay: The variable pay may be in the form \nof share- linked instruments  [including Cash- linked Stock \nAppreciation Rights (CSARs)], or a mix of cash and share- linked \ninstruments. There shall be proper balance between the cash and \nshare-linked components in the variable pay. Only in cases where \nthe compensation by way of share- linked instruments is not \npermitted by law  / regulations, the entire variable pay may be in \ncash. \n(b) Limit on Variable Pay:  It shall be ensured that there is a proper \nbalance between fixed pay and variable pay. In this respect, the \nPVB shall ensure that:\n\ni. In accordance with FSB Implementation Standards, read with \nsub-point (iv) of this subparagraph and BCBS stipulation \nfurnished in paragraph 64(i), a substantial proportion of \ncompensation i.e., at least 50 per cent, shall be variable and \npaid on the basis of individual, business -unit and firm -wide \nmeasures that adequately measure performance, except in \ncases mentioned in sub- point (iii) of this sub paragraph and \nguideline (4). At higher levels of responsibility, the proportion of \nvariable pay shall be higher. The total variable pay shall be \nlimited to a maximum of 300 per cent of the fixed pay (for the \nrelative performance measurement period). \nii. In case variable pay is up to 200 per cent of the fixed pay, a \nminimum of 50 per cent of the variable pay; and in case variable \npay is above 200 per cent, a minimum of 67 per cent of the \nvariable pay shall be via non-cash instruments. \niii. In the event that an executive is barred by statute or regulation \nfrom grant of share-linked instruments, their variable pay shall \nbe capped at 150 per cent of the fixed pay, but shall not be less \nthan 50 per cent of the fixed pay. \niv. The deterioration in the financial performance of the PVB shall \ngenerally lead to a contraction in the total amount of variable \ncompensation, which may even be reduced to zero. \n(c) Deferral of Variable Pay: \ni. For senior executives, including WTDs, and other employees \nwho are MRTs (see guideline (6) below), in adherence to FSB \nImplementation Standards, deferral arrangements shall \ninvariably exist for the variable pay, regardless of the quantum \nof pay. For such executives of a PVB, a minimum of 60 per cent \nof the total variable pay shall be under deferral arrangements. \nFurther, if cash component is part of variable pay, at least 50 \nper cent of the cash bonus shall also be deferred.\n\nii. However, in cases where the cash component of variable pay \nis under ₹25 lakh, deferral requirements may not be necessary. \n(d) Period of Deferral Arrangement:  The deferral period shall be a \nminimum of three years. This shall be applicable to both the cash \nand non-cash components of the variable pay. \n(e) Vesting: Deferred remuneration shall either vest fully at the end of \nthe deferral period or be spread out over the course of the deferral \nperiod. The first such vesting shall not be before one year from the \ncommencement of the deferral period. The vesting shall be no \nfaster than pro rata arrived on a cumulative basis. Additionally, \nvesting shall not take place more frequently than on a yearly basis \nto ensure a proper assessment of risks before the application of \nex post adjustments. \nExplanation: ‘No faster than pro rata basis ’ means vesting shall \nnot be frontloaded. In other words, if the deferral arrangement is \nthree years, not more than 33.33 per cent  of the total granted \nESOPs should vest at the end of first year. Further, not more than \n66.67 per cent of total granted ESOPs should vest at the end of \nsecond year.  \n(f) Share-linked Instruments: Such instruments shall be included as \na component of variable pay. Norms for grant of share- linked \ninstruments shall be framed by a PVB in conformity with relevant \nstatutory provisions and should form part of the PVB’s \ncompensation policy. The details of share- linked instruments \ngranted shall also be disclosed in terms of the disclosure \nrequirements stipulated in the Reserve Bank of India (Commercial \nBanks: Financial Statements  - Presentation and Disclosures) \nDirections, 2025. Share-linked instruments shall be fair valued on \nthe date of grant by the PVB using Black-Scholes model. The fair \nvalue thus arrived at shall be recognised as an expense beginning \nwith the accounting period for which approval has been granted. \n(g) Malus / Clawback\n\ni. The deferred compensation shall be subject to malus  / \nclawback arrangements in the event of subdued or negative \nfinancial performance of  the PVB and / or the relevant line of \nbusiness in any year. \nii. A PVB shall put in place appropriate modalities to incorporate \nmalus / clawback mechanism in respect of variable pay, taking \ninto account Supplementary Guidance issued by FSB in March \n2018 on use of compensation tools to address misconduct risk, \nand all relevant statutory and regulatory stipulations, as \napplicable. A PVB shall identify a representative set of \nsituations in their Compensation Policies, which require it to \ninvoke the malus and clawback clauses that may be applicable \non entire variable pay. When setting criteria for the application \nof malus and clawback, a PVB shall also specify a period during \nwhich malus and / or clawback can be applied, covering at least \ndeferral and retention periods. \niii. Wherever the assessed divergence in PVB’s provisioning for \nNon-Performing Assets (NPAs) or asset classification exceeds \nthe prescribed threshold for public disclosure in terms of \nReserve Bank of India (Commercial Banks : Financial \nStatements - Presentation and Disclosures) Directions, 2025, \na PVB shall not pay the unvested portion of the variable \ncompensation for the assessment year under ‘malus’ clause. \nFurther, in such situations, no proposal for increase in variable \npay (for the assessment year) shall be entertained. In case the \nPVB’s post assessment Gross NPAs are less than 2.0 per cent, \nthese restrictions shall apply only if criteria for public disclosure \nare triggered either on account of divergence in provisioning or \nboth provisioning and asset classification. \n(h) Guaranteed Bonus : Guaranteed bonus is not consistent with \nsound risk  management or the ‘pay for performance’ principles \nand shall not be part of the compensation plan. Therefore, \nguaranteed bonus shall only occur in the context of hiring new staff\n\nas joining / sign-on bonus and be limited to the first year. Further, \njoining / sign-on bonus shall be in the form of share- linked \ninstruments only, since upfront payments in cash would create \nperverse incentives. Such bonus will neither be considered part of \nfixed pay nor part of variable pay. Further, a PVB shall not grant \nseverance pay other than accrued benefits (gratuity, pension, etc.) \nexcept in cases where it is mandatory under any statute. \n(i) Hedging: A PVB shall not permit employees to insure or hedge \ntheir compensation structure to offset the risk alignment effects \nembedded in their compensation arrangement. To enforce the \nsame, a PVB shall establish appropriate compliance \narrangements. \n(4) Guideline 4: For risk control and compliance staff \nMembers of staff engaged in financial and risk control, including internal audit, \nshall be compensated in a manner that is independent of the business areas they \noversee and commensurate with their key role in the PVB. Effective independence \nand appropriate authority of such staff are necessary to preserve the integrity of \nfinancial and risk management’s influence on incentive compensation. Back office \nand employees in the risk control function play a key role in ensuring the integrity \nof risk measures. If their own compensation is significantly affected by short-term \nmeasures, their independence may be compromised. If their compensation is too \nlow, the quality of such employees may be insufficient for their tasks and their \nauthority may be undermined. The mix of fixed and variable compensation for \ncontrol function personnel shall be weighted in favour of fixed compensation. \nTherefore, the requirement of minimum 50 per cent of total compensation to be \npaid in the form of variable pay shall not be applicable for this category of staff. \nHowever, a reasonable proportion of compensation shall be in the form of variable \npay, so that exercising the options of malus and / or clawback, when warranted, \nis not rendered infructuous. Subjec t to the above, while devising compensation \nstructure for such staff, a PVB shall adopt principles similar to principles \nenunciated for WTDs / MD&CEO / CEO, as appropriate. \n(5) Guideline 5: For other categories of staff\n\nWhile these Guidelines do not apply to PVB’s staff other than WTDs / MD&CEO / \nCEO / MRTs and Control Function Staff, a PVB may adopt similar principles, with \nsuitable modifications, as appropriate for them as well. \n(6) Guideline 6: Identification of MRTs of the PVB \nA PVB shall identify its MRTs whose actions have a material impact on the risk \nexposure of the PVB, and who satisfy the qualitative and any one of the \nquantitative criteria given below: \n(i) Standard Qualitative criteria: Relate to the role and decision- making \npower of staff members (e.g., seni or manager, member of management \nbody) having jointly or individually, the authority to commit significantly to \nrisk exposures, etc. \n(ii) Standard Quantitative Criteria: \n(a) Their total remuneration exceeds a certain threshold; the \ndetermination of which may be done prudently by the PVB, or \n(b) They are included among the 0.3 per cent of staff with the highest \nremuneration in the PVB, or \n(c) Their remuneration is equal to or greater than the lowest total \nremuneration of senior management and other risk-takers. \nA PVB shall refer to the BCBS report titled ‘Range of Methodologies for Risk and \nPerformance Alignment of Remuneration’ published in May 2011 to enhance its \nunderstanding of risk-adjusted remuneration. \n(7) Guideline 7: Disclosure \nA PVB shall make disclosure on remuneration of WTDs / MD&CEO / CEO / MRTs \non an annual basis at the minimum, in their Annual Financial Statements as \nprescribed in Reserve Bank of India (Commercial Banks: Financial Statements – \nPresentation and Disclosures) Directions, 2025, as amended from time to time. \n(8) The aforementioned guidelines cover the principles of effective governance of \ncompensation (Guidelines 1 and 2) and effective alignment of compensation with \nprudent risk taking (Guidelines 3 to 7). With respect to the principle of r egulatory \nand supervisory approval / oversight, it is reiterated that:\n\n(i) in terms of the Section 10(1)(b)(iii) of the B.R. Act, 1949, no banking \ncompany shall employ or continue the employment of any person whose \nremuneration is, in the opinion of RBI, excessive;  \n(ii) a PVB operating in India is required to obtain regulatory approval for grant \nof remuneration to WTDs  / MD&CEO / CEO  in terms of Section 35B of \nthe B.R. Act, 1949; and \n(iii) a PVB’s compensation polic y shall also be subject to supervisory \noversight including review under Basel framework. Deficiencies observed \nin this regard shall have the effect of increasing the risk profile of the PVB \nwith attendant consequences, including a requirement of additional \ncapital if the deficiencies are very significant.",

    "text": "64. BCBS Methodologies for risk and performance alignment of remuneration:  \nThe BCBS in consultation with the FSB had published a report in May 2011 titled \n‘Range of Methodologies for Risk and Performance Alignment of Remuneration’. \nThe main objectives of the report are (a) to present certain remuneration practices \nand methodologies that support sound incentives; and (b) the elements \ninfluencing the effectiveness of risk alignment that should be considered by banks \nwhen developing their methodologies as well as by supervisors, when reviewing \nand assessing banks’ practices; according to which: \n(i) A PVB shall ensure that the variable part of remuneration is truly and \neffectively variable and may even be reduced to zero,  in line with the \nsymmetry principle defined by the FSB. A PVB shall be able to \ndemonstrate to supervisors that the methodologies used to adjust variable \nremuneration to risk and perf ormance are appropriate to its specific \ncircumstances; \n(ii) The methodologies adopted by a PVB for aligning remuneration with risk \nand performance shall be consistent with its general risk management \nand corporate governance framework. \n(iii) Performance measures and their relation to remuneration packages shall \nbe clearly defined at the beginning of the performance measurement \nperiod to ensure that the employees of a PVB perceive the incentive \nmechanism. The usual annual determination of bonus shall be based on\n\nrules, processes and objectives known in advance, although some degree \nof discretion may be retained. \n(iv) A PVB shall use a combination of financial and non-financial measures to \nassess employee performance and adapt the measurement to each \nemployee’s specific situation. Qualitative factors  viz., knowledge, skills \nand abilities may be considered, particularly where these serve to \nreinforce the PVB’s risk management goals. \n(v) The nature and extent to which risk adjustments are needed in \nremuneration shall depend on the extent to which performance measures \ncapture risks . In all cases, risk adjustment shall be made, given that \nremuneration is often awarded before the final outcome of an activity is \nknown. A PVB shall estimate risks ex ante and monitor outcomes ex post, \nwith both influencing the final payouts. \n(vi) Risk adjustments shall take into account the nature of the risks involved \nand the time horizons over which they may emerge. The impact of \nremuneration adjustments shall be linked to actions taken by employees \nand / or business units, and their impact on the level of risk taken on by \nthe PVB. \n(vii) A PVB shall carefully consider the nature of the award process, which \nlinks the variable remuneration of each individual employee with bonus \npools and the total amount of variable remuneration at a PVB’s level, as \nit directly influences how and when performance and risk adjustment are \nor may be used.",
